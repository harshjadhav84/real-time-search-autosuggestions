# Real-Time Search with Auto-Suggestions

## Repository Name
**real-time-search-autosuggestions**

---

## **Feature Overview**
This project implements a Real-Time Search with Auto-Suggestions feature that dynamically fetches and displays suggestions based on user input. The feature includes:
- Real-time search with dynamic dropdown suggestions.
- Highlighting of matching text in suggestions for better usability.
- Keyboard navigation support for suggestions (arrow keys and Enter).
- Friendly error handling and informative empty states.
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user types a query into the search bar.
   - Suggestions are displayed dynamically based on the input.

2. **Dynamic Suggestions**:
   - Matching results are displayed in a dropdown beneath the search bar.
   - The matched portion of the text is highlighted.

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Users can navigate through the suggestions using the `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` keys and select a suggestion with the `Enter` key.

4. **Error and Empty States**:
   - If no matches are found, a "No results found!" message is displayed.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., network failure), a user-friendly error message is shown.

## **How to Configure the API or Data Source**

### Using Mock Data
- The project uses a predefined array (`mockData`) in the `script.js` file as the data source.
- This is ideal for testing without connecting to a live API.

### Connecting to an API
1. Replace the mock data logic in the `fetchSuggestions` function in `script.js` with an API call. Example:
   ```javascript
   async function fetchSuggestions(query) {
       try {
           const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/search?q=${query}`);
           const results = await response.json();
           // Process and display results...
       } catch (error) {
           errorMessage.classList.remove('d-none');
           console.error('Error fetching suggestions:', error);
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure the API endpoint returns a JSON response in the following format:
   ```json
   [
       "Apple",
       "Banana",
       "Cherry",
       "Date",
       "Elderberry"
   ]
   ```

3. Update the API endpoint in the script to match your backend configuration.

4. Test the feature with live API data.
